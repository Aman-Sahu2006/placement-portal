# Placement Portal

A web-based placement management system built with Flask that connects **Students**, **Companies**, and **College Admins** on a single platform to streamline campus recruitment drives — from posting job openings to tracking applications and final selections.

## Features

### Admin
- Approve, reject, or blacklist company registrations
- Approve or reject placement drives posted by companies
- View, edit, deactivate, or delete student profiles
- Monitor all applications across the platform
- Search across students, companies, and drives

### Company
- Register and manage a company profile (pending admin approval)
- Create, edit, close, or delete placement drives
- View and manage applications received for each drive
- Update applicant status (shortlisted / selected / rejected)

### Student
- Register and manage a personal profile (branch, year, CGPA, skills, resume upload)
- Browse and view details of open placement drives
- Apply to eligible drives
- Track the status of all submitted applications

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** SQLite via Flask-SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemy 2.x)
